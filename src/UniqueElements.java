    /*
    ou are given an array A of N elements. You have to make all elements unique. To do so, in one step you can increase any number by one.

Find the minimum number of steps.



Problem Constraints
1 <= N <= 105
1 <= A[i] <= 109



Input Format
The only argument given is an Array A, having N integers.



Output Format
Return the minimum number of steps required to make all elements unique.



Example Input
Input 1:

 A = [1, 1, 3]
Input 2:

 A = [2, 4, 5]


Example Output
Output 1:

 1
Output 2:

 0
